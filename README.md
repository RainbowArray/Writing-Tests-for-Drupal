# Writing Tests for Drupal
I am working on improving my ability to write tests for Drupal: particularly for core and contrib development. Rather than just keep notes for myself, I thought I would share the resources I find in this repo so others can learn from this and contribute.

If you have resources you would like to contribute, feel free to fire up a pull request!
